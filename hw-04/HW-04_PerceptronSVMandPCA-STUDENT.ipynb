    "As the number of PCA components increases from 1 to 6, there is a notable increase in accuracy. The accuracy starts at approximately 44.23% with just one component and increases to about 80.77% with 6 components. After reaching 6 components, the accuracy appears to plateau. From 6 to 15 components, the accuracy fluctuates slightly but generally remains around 80.77%. There is no significant improvement in accuracy despite increasing the number of components beyond 6. <br>\n",
