    "The change in the relationship between body mass and bill depth when we separate the data by penguin species is a great example of why it's important to consider the context of data. Penguins come in different species, each with unique body characteristics. Gentoo penguins are generally larger and have deeper bills compared to Adélie and Chinstrap penguins. When we look at all the penguins together, the larger size of the Gentoos might skew our perception, making it seem like penguins with deeper bills always weigh more. However, when we split the data by species, we see the true story for each group. "

If the first classifier is highly confident that the penguin is an Adélie, the decision can be made immediately. Otherwise, the other two classifiers' probabilities would be considered."
